# CloudFormation-Project
Please use this template to create the topology that we discussed during our call. This includes separate subnets for each department, and corresponding L4 firewalling (Security Groups) built in.
The template also includes a public instance (bastion host). The best practice is to use the bastion host to SSH into private instances. You'll need to modify the SG's accordingly.

Please reach out offline for a demo and how to use it with your AWS account.
