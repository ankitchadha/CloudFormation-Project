# CloudFormation-Project
Please use this template to create the topology that we discussed during our call. This includes separate subnets for each department, and corresponding L4 firewalling (Security Groups) built in.
The template also includes a public subnet, in case you'd like to SSH to the instance. The best practice would be to use this public instance to SSH into private instances.

Please reach out offline for a demo and how to use it with your AWS account.
